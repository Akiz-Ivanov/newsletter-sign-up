## My process

### Built with

- **Vanilla JavaScript** – for form validation and dynamic UI
- **Tailwind CSS** – for styling and responsive design
- **Flexbox** – for layout
- **Mobile-first workflow**

### What I learned

I chose to build this with plain JavaScript instead of React as a refresher and to challenge myself with manual DOM manipulation and validation logic. Even if React might've made the state transitions slightly easier.

Additionally, I practiced adapting SVG illustrations across breakpoints, balancing visuals between tablet and mobile layouts.
